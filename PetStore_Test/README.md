# PetStore Test Automation

## Introduction ðŸš€

PetStore_Test is a testing automation designed for testing [PetStore](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-petstore/) sample RESTful API

This testing automation is divided in three features that will be tested: Pets, Store and User. Every feature is designed for testing each, or almost each, API operation (post, put, get, delete) and verify its response, in some cases, also verify specific field of json response that provide a value that can be compare with another field of json request

## Requirements

* Java JDK 1.8
 
* Gradle preferably with version 6.5.1 or upper

* Swagger [PetStore](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-petstore/) Sample setting up and running localy


## Tools used to build project ðŸ› 

* [Gradle](https://maven.apache.org/)
* Serenity BDD - Open source library for reports generate
* Serenity Rest - Open source library to consume REST and SOAP APIs
* Gherkin - Business Readable Languaje DSL
* Cucumber - Tool used for implementing BDD Methodologies, wich is responsible to translate functional descriptions written in plain text as automated software tests


## To run Tests:

To run all test cases, run next tasks in main project's root via command promt:

```
gradlew clean build test --tests *PetManagement --tests *StoreManagement --tests *UsersManagement aggregate --info
```
